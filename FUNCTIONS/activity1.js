//  Activity 1: Aproved students

//     1 - Create a function that receive the array students and a number that will represent the final average
//     2 - Run through the array and populate a new step array with only the students which grades are higher or equal the  final average
//     3 - Use the "object destructuring" technique to manipulate the desired properties of each student
